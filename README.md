# RabbitMQ [Examples](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html)

To make this work ...

* you need to have RabbitMQ to be up and running
  * and it is recommended that you have the [admin web ui tool](http://localhost:15672) up and running
* you need to have the usual stuff installed (git, erlang, elixir, ...)
* then you clone the repo, `cd` into one of the tutorials (e.g. `apps/hello`) and follow the instructions in the README
